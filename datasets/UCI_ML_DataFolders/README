This directory contains subdirectories in the same structure
as a subset of UCI Machine Learning Repository. The file
"links.txt" in each directory contains URLs of the files of
the data sets contained in this directory. The data may be
downloaded, for example, using "wget" command line tool. See
also the function "dsDownload()" in CRAN package "readMLData",
which provides a wrapper to "wget" and simplifies its use
in different directories.

The data sets

  breast-cancer.data
  lymphography.data
  primary-tumor.data

cannot be downloaded, since their access is restricted and the
user has to ask the maintainer of UCI Machine Learning Repository
for them.

In order to use the downloaded data with CRAN package "readMLData"

  http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/packages/readMLData/index.html

it is necessary to extract the files *.Z, namely

  connect-4/connect-4.data.Z
  page-blocks/page-blocks.data.Z
  statlog/shuttle/shuttle.trn.Z
  waveform/waveform-+noise.data.Z

for example, using "gunzip" or "gzip -d".

The lines 522 and 523 of the file cylinder-bands/bands.data
should be joined to a single line.
